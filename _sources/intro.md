# Pi-WRF Teaching Box 

The purpose of the Pi-WRF Teaching Box is to drive a community effort for developing teaching modules related to numerical weather prediction (NWP) using Pi-WRF. The project aims to address Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) through dynamic teaching modules related to numerical weather prediction.
