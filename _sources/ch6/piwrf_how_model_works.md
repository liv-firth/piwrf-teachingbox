# Pi-WRF How the Model Works 

Creating a real world forecast is a complicated process. It involves combining observations (from satellites, weather balloons, radars, aircraft, buoys, etc.) and short term forecasts, a process called data assimilation. The end goal of data assimilation is to create the initial conditions for the weather model, which is essentially a snapshot of the atmosphere. The initial conditions tell the weather model what the values are for pressure, temperature, wind, and water vapor throughout the entire atmosphere. Once the initial state of the atmosphere is known, the weather model runs, and physics and mathematics take over as the weather model begins to simulate weather in the future.
